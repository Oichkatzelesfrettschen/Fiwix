# SysV Semaphore Analysis

This document summarizes static analysis of the System V semaphore implementation using a suite of tooling for cross
reference, complexity measurement, and static diagnostics.

## Lizard Complexity Summary
`lizard include/fiwix/sem.h kernel/syscalls/semop.c kernel/syscalls/ipc.c`

Results highlight `sys_semop` as the most complex function due to branching around semaphore operations.

## Cscope Symbol Lookup
`cscope -L -0 sys_semop`
`cscope -L -0 sys_ipc`

## Ctags Cross-Reference
`ctags -x include/fiwix/sem.h kernel/syscalls/semop.c kernel/syscalls/ipc.c`

Key structures and functions:
- `struct semid_ds` manages semaphore set metadata.
- `sys_semop` performs semaphore operations with undo support.
- `ipc_init` initializes semaphores, message queues, and shared memory.

## Cflow Call Graph
`cflow -m sys_semop kernel/syscalls/semop.c kernel/syscalls/ipc.c`

Traverses the control flow from `sys_semop` into helper routines, outlining semaphore checks and wakeup paths.

## Cppcheck Diagnostics
`cppcheck --enable=all --inconclusive --library=posix include/fiwix/sem.h kernel/syscalls/semop.c kernel/syscalls/ipc.c`

Flags style and portability concerns without identifying semaphore-specific defects.

## Sparse Type Analysis
`sparse -Wbitwise -Wno-decl -Iinclude kernel/syscalls/semop.c kernel/syscalls/ipc.c`

Reveals incomplete network structure definitions included during semaphore builds, suggesting broader header review.

## Doxygen Extraction
`doxygen docs/analysis/Doxyfile`

Generates XML descriptors cataloged in `doxygen-report.md` to document semaphore interfaces.
