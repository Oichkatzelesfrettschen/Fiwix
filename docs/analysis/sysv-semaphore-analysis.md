# SysV Semaphore Analysis

This document summarizes static analysis of the System V semaphore implementation.

## Lizard Complexity Summary
The complexity scan identifies `sys_semop` as the dominant hotspot due to extensive branching around semaphore operations.

## Cscope Symbol Lookup
Cross-referencing `sys_semop` and `sys_ipc` exposes the entry points and usage sites for semaphore management.

## Ctags Cross-Reference
Key structures and functions include `struct semid_ds` for semaphore metadata and `ipc_init` for initializing IPC facilities.

## Cflow Call Graph
The call graph traces `sys_semop` through permission checks, undo handling, and scheduler wakeups.

## Cppcheck Diagnostics
Static diagnostics highlight style and portability concerns but no semaphore-specific defects.

## Sparse Type Analysis
Sparse reveals incomplete network structure definitions pulled in during semaphore builds, indicating the need for broader header review.

## Doxygen Extraction
Generated descriptors document semaphore interfaces for cross-referencing.
