# Thanks

A huge THANKS to all people who created their own hobby, and not so hobby,
operating systems and made them freely available on Internet.

From those simple "Hello world!\n" kernels to a real self-hosting operating
system, their projects were a invaluable source of information and inspiration
for Fiwix.

A special thanks to the OSDEV Community for their tutorials, documents, wikis,
and more.
